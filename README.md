 ### In VSCode

 Open a terminal in VSCode
 Create a new directory
 

     mkdir golang-tutorial
     cd golang-tutorial

 Now we need to add go modules file for easy build. Run the below command. "your_mod_name" can be any name you like to use. 

 

    go mod init "your_mod_name"
    go build

 To Start debugging, press **F5** or go to **Run** menu and **Start Debugging**
`## Project Structure


### Simple Project Structure Explanation:

- **`main.go`**: The main Go file, typically the entry point of your application.
- **`go.mod`**: Go module file, which includes the module path and dependency requirements.
